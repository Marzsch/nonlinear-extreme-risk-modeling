# Nonlinear models, Extreme values distribution and Copulas.
Nonlinear financial time series project combining extreme value modeling (GEV), dependence structures via copulas, Markov switching and STAR models, and long-memory estimation (ARFIMA). Applied to equities, bond spreads, and macro time series.

We aim to enhance our understanding of the correlation principles and inference of extreme values distribution before estimating with regime-switching models the data and make predictions out of it.

The final output should be a PDF paper that answer to an actual academic assignement but moreover, it is a repository to display knowledges and techniques in the domain and show some practice.
